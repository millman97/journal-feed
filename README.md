Project made as a week-long group project by the students of the FutureProof Bootcamp (Auguste cohort) on LAP 1.

## Description
This is the frontend client for our Journal Project, which interacts with the backend kept in a separate repository available [here](https://github.com/xargon666/Journal_Project_Backend).

The app allows users to create and comment on posts which are stored in the server. Posts can also be deleted, and there are several reaction emoji's available.

## üíæ Deployment
The fontend app has been deployed on Netlify at [this link](#).
